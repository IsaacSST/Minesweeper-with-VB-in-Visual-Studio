# Minesweeper-with-VB-in-Visual-Studio
Minesweeper reverse engineered from scratch with login and highscore features, built in Visual Studio with windows forms. Made as part of a project for A level Computer Science.
## Downloading and launching the program:
To download the game just download the MinesweeperProject.exe file above. This file appears in the /MinesweeperProject/MinesweeperProject/bin/Debug/ directory upon compiling, but I copied it to the base directory for ease of access.
Most likely the browser will attempt to block the download and operating system will warn you against opening as it is an untrusted exe file. If you really want to play you will have to go into advanced options and bypass these warnings.
The entire game is encompassed in the .exe file; no installation is necessary.
