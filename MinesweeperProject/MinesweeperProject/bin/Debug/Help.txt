Navigation--------------------------------

To play the game, you must first log in. You can do this by entering your username and password in the main menu and pressing the Log in button
if the account already exists, or the create account button if the account does not yet exist.
This will bring you to a Landing page where you should press the new game button.
Then you will be asked to state the dimensions of the game board. As the board is always a square, only one number is needed.
This should be a whole number between 10 and 40 but if you enter a decimal, the program will round it down.
After this the board will load and you can start playing.
The menu will be on the right of the screen and can be still be used when the game is running

How to play-------------------------------

The game starts with a simple board of squares, each containing either a mine,
 a number indicating number of surrounding mines, or nothing at all.
If a player clicks a square with a mine under, the game will end; if player clicks a square with a number on, that square will be revealed;
 if a player clicks a blank square, all connected blank and numbered squares will be revealed.
Also, the player may right click on a square to place a flag on it if they think a mine is there.
If a revealed numbered square has its number satisfied by adjacent flagged squares, 
 then the player may double click, or middle click on this number to clear all adjacent squares other than the flagged squares.
If there are too many or too few flags adjacent, nothing will happen, however if there are the right amount but they are incorrect,
 the actual mines will be revealed and the player will lose the game.

Interface---------------------------------

When the game is being played, the number of mines left, a restart button and a game timer will be just above the board.
The restart button contains a yellow face, and when clicked will reset the game.

Scoring-----------------------------------

The scoring of the game depends on how long it takes for the user to beat the game, therefore the lower the score, the better.
If they lose by triggering a mine, they have no score.
